API Reference
=============

This page documents the Application Programming Interface (API) for the PyTiled Parser library.

Throughout the API documentation you will see links labeled both TMX Reference and JSON Reference.
These links go to the official Tiled documentation for that specific type. Sometimes there is not a
one to one mapping, so it may lead to the closest thing in the Tiled format.

At some points certain classes modules may have links to other parts of the Tiled documentation which
cover some of the concepts surrounding that module and it's usage within Tiled.
